-- Why: To find best performers.

SELECT cryptocurrency, ROUND (AVG(price_change_24h_percent),2) AS avg_price_change
FROM crypto_sentiment
GROUP BY cryptocurrency
ORDER BY avg_price_change DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Bitcoin	0.87 has had the hifhest average price increase.


-- 12. Compare average RSI between coins with confidence level > 80 and < 50.
-- Why: To test if prediction confidence matches market signal.

SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN prediction_confidence > 80 THEN 'High'
    WHEN prediction_confidence < 50 THEN 'Low'
  END AS confidence_group,
  ROUND(AVG(rsi_technical_indicator), 2) AS avg_rsi
FROM crypto_sentiment
WHERE prediction_confidence > 80 OR prediction_confidence < 50
GROUP BY confidence_group;

-- Answer: High 50.28


-- 13. Does higher sentiment score lead to more social mentions?

SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(social_mentions_count)) AS avg_mentions,
  CASE 
    WHEN social_sentiment_score > 0 THEN 'Positive'
    WHEN social_sentiment_score < 0 THEN 'Negative'
    ELSE 'Neutral'
  END AS sentiment_type
FROM crypto_sentiment
GROUP BY sentiment_type;

-- Answer  1180	Positive  1259	Negative  577	Neutral

       ROUND(AVG(prediction_confidence), 2) AS avg_confidence
FROM crypto_sentiment
GROUP BY cryptocurrency
ORDER BY avg_confidence DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Answer: Avalanche has the highest average prediction confidence at 77.96

SELECT COUNT(*) AS low_confidence_count
FROM crypto_sentiment
WHERE prediction_confidence < 30;

-- Answer: There are no low confidecne score below  30.


--  17. Which coin has the lowest average sentiment but highest average price?

-- Explanatin : We want to find the coin that people donâ€™t talk positively about (low sentiment) but still has a very high price.
SELECT cryptocurrency, 
       ROUND(AVG(social_sentiment_score), 2) AS avg_sentiment,
       ROUND(AVG(current_price_usd), 2) AS avg_price
FROM crypto_sentiment
GROUP BY cryptocurrency
ORDER BY avg_sentiment ASC, avg_price DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Answer: Avalanche has lowest average sentiment score and highest average price.alter


-- 18. Compare social mentions between coins with high vs low RSI
-- Explanantuion: We want to know if coins that are overbought (RSI > 70) or oversold (RSI < 30) get more attention (measured by social mentions).

SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN rsi_technical_indicator > 70 THEN 'High RSI'
    WHEN rsi_technical_indicator < 30 THEN 'Low RSI'
    ELSE 'Normal'
  END AS rsi_group,
  ROUND(AVG(social_mentions_count), 0) AS avg_mentions
FROM crypto_sentiment
GROUP BY rsi_group;

--  Answer: Low RSI	1368 Normal	1216 High RSI	1125
-- Oversold Coins get more social mentions

-- 19  Are high-confidence predictions more accurate?
-- Weâ€™re checking if high-confidence predictions (confidence > 80%) actually have better price performance than low-confidence ones (< 50%).

SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN prediction_confidence > 80 THEN 'High'
    WHEN prediction_confidence < 50 THEN 'Low'
  END AS confidence_level,
  ROUND(AVG(price_change_24h_percent), 2) AS avg_price_change
FROM crypto_sentiment
WHERE prediction_confidence > 80 OR prediction_confidence < 50
GROUP BY confidence_level;

-- Answer: Hig at 0.18. This means only high confidence predictions exist in the dataset. Which means we don't know if low confidence predictions exists and hence cannot conclude.

-- 20. Which coins show opposite trends in sentiment vs price?
SELECT cryptocurrency,
       ROUND(AVG(social_sentiment_score), 2) AS avg_sentiment,
       ROUND(AVG(price_change_24h_percent), 2) AS avg_price_change
FROM crypto_sentiment
GROUP BY cryptocurrency
HAVING avg_sentiment < 0 AND avg_price_change > 0;

-- answer: Bitcon showed opposite trends in sentiment vs price.
