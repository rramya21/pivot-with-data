# pivot-with-data

Solving real-world problems using data, analysis, and automation workflows.

This is my personal data portfolio where I explore practical business questions using tools like Excel, SQL, and automation platforms such as n8n. 
The goal is to build thoughtful, real-world projects that show how data can be used to uncover insights and improve decision-making.

## What's included (or coming soon)

- SQL files for answering business questions and exploring patterns (e.g., churn, retention, customer segments)
- Excel dashboards using pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting
- Automation workflows using n8n to streamline reporting or data tasks

## Project structure (coming together)
> Currently, the first SQL project is available. More content will be added over time.


## Tools used

- Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets  
- MySQL  
- n8n (open-source automation)  
- Git and GitHub for version control


## About this repository

This project is part of my learning journey in data analysis. I'm using this space to practice and build up a collection of work that reflects real-world skills and curiosity-driven problem solving. More projects and updates will be added over time.
