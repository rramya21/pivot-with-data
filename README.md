# pivot-with-data

Solving real-world problems using data, analysis, and automation workflows.

This is my personal data portfolio where I explore practical business questions using tools like Excel, SQL, and automation platforms such as n8n. 
The goal is to build thoughtful, real-world projects that show how data can be used to uncover insights and improve decision-making.

## What's included (or coming soon)

- SQL files for answering business questions and exploring patterns (e.g., churn, retention, customer segments)
- Excel dashboards using pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting
- Automation workflows using n8n to streamline reporting or data tasks
